  "1": "Welcome to the Mild West! A crappy text adventure made when bore in class! Let's just jump right into your current situation. You're headed towards a town called DankWood and come across a Bull in the desert. Since this story has gotta be interesting you must choose one of these options.",
  "2": "You. are. \"Milking.\" A. BULL! BULLS DO NOT HAVE UDDERS FOR YOU TO MILK.",
  "3": "Well Since you don't have a bucket you end up just leaning back and squirting it into your mouth. But wait... Something is very wrong...",
  "4": "The only thing to \"Milk\" down there on a MALE COW is... It's weiner. That sure ain't milk, and you sure don't think about what you're doing that well do you... Because you just jumped to essentially giving some random bull in the desert a handjob. But you know the worst part? That bull hasn't kicked you or anything. It must like it! Yuck...",
  "5": "Are you absolutely sure? I really don't know what you are trying to get out of this, but it's not worth it man.",
  "6": "Wait yeah there is! I can end the program to prevent your wretched actions!",
  "7": "Yeah don't you touch that poor thing! What did it ever do to you, you monster!",
  "8": "You mercilessly hack at the bull with your fists, as you decided to kill this random bull even though you have no weapon. By the time you are done, it is just a big heap of bruises.",
  "9": "Unfortunately just like what is left of the bull, your fists are bruised and bleeding profusely as well.",
  "10": "Lucky for you however, this is a computer game, so time is relative. Therefore, after you wait a long while, your fists scab over and you realize that your body has created an entire layer of protective scabs a quarter inch thick to try and combat your stupidity. Also lucky for you this means that your hits will fall harder."
